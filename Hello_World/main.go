	   Important points:

	   1. There are 4 ways to run a go program --> go build, go run, go install & go playground.

	   2. Every go file should start with 'package name' statement.

	   3. Understanding each line of the code above:xâ€œ

	     - package main is the package that has been used here. Packages are used to provide code reusability
	     - import statement is used to import a package. Here, fmt package is imported to print the text to standard output.
	     - func main is a special function from where execution of a program starts.
	     - package.Function() is the syntax to call a function in a package. For eg. Println is the function in fmt package.
